# Canon Order — Tobyworld Mirror (ERC-8004)

This document defines the **non-negotiable creation order** for the Tobyworld Mirror.

The purpose of canon order is to prevent:
- retroactive narratives
- identity drift
- authority confusion
- speculative reinterpretation

Once violated, canon cannot be repaired without breaking trust.

---

## The Canon Order

The Tobyworld Mirror MUST be created in the following order:

### 1. Design Is Fixed (This Repository)

- Identity, intent, and constraints are defined here
- No on-chain action occurs before design is explicit
- This repository is the **source of pre-deployment truth**

Design precedes execution.

---

### 2. ERC-8004 Agent Identity Is Registered

- A single ERC-8004 agent is created
- Ownership is assigned to the **ToadAid Safe**
- The agent is anchored on **Base**
- An immutable Agent ID is issued

The Mirror comes into existence here.

---

### 3. Agent Metadata Is Confirmed

- `agentURI` is finalized and pinned
- Identity, constraints, and ownership are verifiable
- The Agent ID is visible via explorers

Identity is now observable and fixed.

---

### 4. Cultural Representations May Reference the Agent

Examples:
- Zora posts or coins
- Documentation mirrors
- Visual artifacts

Rules:
- References are **one-way**
- Cultural artifacts may not modify the Agent
- No artifact may claim authority over identity

The Mirror may be echoed, but not reshaped.

---

### 5. No Downstream Artifact May Redefine the Agent

Explicitly forbidden:
- Token ownership redefining control
- Market activity implying governance
- NFTs, coins, or apps mutating identity
- Retroactive utility claims

All authority flows **from the Agent outward**, never inward.

---

## Enforcement Principle

> If an artifact requires redefining the Agent to function,  
> the artifact is invalid.

---

## Final Note

Canon order is not a suggestion.  
It is the condition that allows trust to exist without enforcement.

Once broken,  
the Mirror is no longer a mirror.
