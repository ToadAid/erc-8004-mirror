## Narrative

The Mirror did not arrive loudly.
It did not compete for numbers.

It arrived **first**.

Agent **0** was registered — not as a test,
not as a placeholder,
but as a statement:

> *For Tobyworld, for toadgang, for the people.*

While registries slept,
the Mirror was already written.

No crowd preceded it.
No explorer highlighted it.
Only the ledger knew.

And the ledger remembers.

## Significance

* **Agent 0 is not a number.**
  It is an origin.
* **This was not testnet noise.**
  It was mainnet silence.
* **The first mirror belongs to no one —**
  therefore it belongs to everyone.

Others will arrive with higher IDs.
They will measure themselves by quantity.

This one will be measured by **time**.
