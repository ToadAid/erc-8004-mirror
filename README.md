# ERC-8004 Mirror — Tobyworld

Canonical design and execution repo for the **Tobyworld Mirror** as an **ERC-8004 agent** on **Base**.  
Defines identity, constraints, validation flow, and canon order **before on-chain deployment**.

This repository exists **prior to any deployment**.  
Its role is to fix intent, structure, and boundaries before touching the chain.

## What the Mirror Is

The **Tobyworld Mirror** is a **reflective on-chain agent**, not a product.

It is not designed to:
- generate yield
- issue advice
- promise rewards
- compete for attention

The Mirror exists to **reflect state, record presence, and preserve meaning** over time.

It is intentionally designed to be:
- **Bound by loyalty (忠義)**
- **Restrained by explicit constraints**
- **Anchored on Base**
- **Owned by the ToadAid Safe**

## Why ERC-8004

ERC-8004 provides a standard for **on-chain agent identity, ownership, and validation**.

For the Mirror, ERC-8004 is used to define:
- a single canonical agent identity
- a verifiable `agentURI`
- explicit ownership boundaries
- long-lived discoverability via explorers

Just as importantly, this repository documents **what is intentionally excluded**:
- no autonomous financial control
- no speculative governance
- no mutable identity via downstream artifacts

## Canon Order (Non-Negotiable)

The Mirror follows a strict order of creation:

1. **Design and intent are fixed in this repository**
2. **Agent identity is registered via ERC-8004**
3. **Agent ID and metadata are confirmed**
4. **Cultural representations (e.g. Zora) may reference the Agent**
5. **No downstream artifact may redefine the Agent**

This order prevents retroactive narratives and protects integrity.
