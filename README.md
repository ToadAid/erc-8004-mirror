# erc-8004-mirror
Canonical design and execution repo for the Tobyworld Mirror as an ERC-8004 agent on Base. Defines identity, constraints, validation flow, and canon order before on-chain deployment.

# ERC-8004 Mirror — Tobyworld

This repository defines the **canonical design and execution plan** for the **Tobyworld Mirror** as an **ERC-8004 agent** deployed on **Base**.

This repo exists **before any on-chain deployment**.  
Its purpose is to fix **identity, constraints, validation flow, and canon order** prior to execution.

## What the Mirror Is

The Tobyworld Mirror is a **reflective agent**, not a product.

- It does not generate yield  
- It does not issue advice  
- It does not promise reward  

The Mirror exists to **reflect state, record presence, and preserve meaning**.

It is designed to be:
- **Bound by loyalty (忠義)**
- **Restrained by explicit constraints**
- **Anchored on Base**
- **Owned by the ToadAid Safe**

## Why ERC-8004

ERC-8004 provides a standard for **on-chain agent identity and validation**.

For the Mirror, ERC-8004 is used to define:
- a single canonical agent identity
- a verifiable agent URI
- ownership and validation boundaries
- long-lived discoverability via explorers

This repo documents **how ERC-8004 is applied**, and just as importantly, **what is intentionally excluded**.

## Canon Order (Non-Negotiable)

The Mirror follows a strict order of creation:

1. **Design is fixed in this repository**
2. **Agent identity is registered via ERC-8004**
3. **Agent ID and metadata are confirmed**
4. **Cultural representations (e.g. Zora) may reference the Agent**
5. **No downstream artifact may redefine the Agent**

This order prevents retroactive narratives and protects integrity.

## Ownership & Control

- **Owner:** ToadAid Safe  
- **Chain:** Base  
- **Governance:** Explicit, minimal, revocable  
- **Market activity:** None  

The Mirror is **not owned by individuals** and **not governed by tokens**.

---

## Status

- **Phase:** Design / Pre-deployment  
- **On-chain contracts:** Not yet deployed  
- **Agent ID:** Not yet registered  

No minting, trading, or deployment has occurred.

## License

This license applies to **documentation and design artifacts only**.

On-chain deployments, when executed, define canonical truth via chain state — not this repository.
